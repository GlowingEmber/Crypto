size of each random pool grows at the rate of
2^(K*ALPHA) - 1
so if we are working with k = 3, ALPHA = 4
aka 3-SAT with four clauses per beta row,
then we will have a maximum of 2^12 - 1 = 4096
possible terms that R can select from

^ recall that this does not remove
the literals of C_i from the options
because we do not know if there was "overlap"
between a literal in C_i and somewhere else

Perhaps if BETA was the maximum length
then we know there was overlap
